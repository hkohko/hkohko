## Hi, I'm Rifdi Andzar Nazhara 👋

> Make tools to make learning other tools easier.

💻 Currently working on:  
- [dget](https://github.com/rfdzan/dget) 🧰, a command-line tool to search for paths in your filesystem. Uses Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching
- [jippigy](https://github.com/rfdzan/jippigy) 🖼️, a multi-threaded JPG compression crate powered by [turbojpeg](https://github.com/honzasp/rust-turbojpeg).

🔍 Currently interested in:
- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)

Excited to use Python 🐍 or Rust 🦀 wherever he can.
