## Hi, I'm Rifdi Andzar Nazhara 👋

💻 Currently working on:  
- [space-station-rs](https://github.com/hkohko/space-station-rs) 🚀, a terminal-based game to learn and demonstrate Rust's rich type system.
- Product website (still private) with Flask backend.

Excited to use Python 🐍 or Rust 🦀 wherever he can.
