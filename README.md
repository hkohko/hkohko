- [jippigy](https://github.com/rfdzan/jippigy) 🖼️, a multi-threaded JPG compression crate powered by [turbojpeg](https://github.com/honzasp/rust-turbojpeg).
- Indonesian [translation](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/pull/609) for [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) 📝.
