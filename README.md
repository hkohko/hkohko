## Hi, I'm Rifdi Andzar Nazhara 👋

> Make tools to make learning other tools easier.

💻 Currently working on:  
- [dget](https://github.com/rfdzan/dget) 🧰, a command-line tool to search for paths in your filesystem. Uses Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching.
- Product website (still private) with Flask backend.

🔍 Currently interested in:
- [Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin) 🔱

Excited to use Python 🐍 or Rust 🦀 wherever he can.
